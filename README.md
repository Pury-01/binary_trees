# This project is on binary tree.
# Explores the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Sea	rch Tree.
# Looks into possible gain in terms of time complexity compared 	to linked lists.
# Covers the depth, height and size of a binary tree; the different traversal methods to got hrough a binary tree and what is a complete, full, perfect, balanced binary tree.
